- PPDS9 fitting added.

Version 1.4.2
- Bug correction: The structure for multiparameter EOS data was limiting the number of terms below the used.

Version 1.4.1
- Bug correction: The vapor density calculated by the multiparameter EOS was divided by 0.8.

Version 1.4.0
- Much improved density solver, that allows to work at fractions of degree from the critical point and at high pressure.

Version 1.1.4

- An improved simulation annealing algorithm is now used for both tangent plane, and global Gibbs energy, minimization.
 The algorithm stores the best result obtained at high temperatures and performs a final loop at low temperature to improve accuracy.

- A differential evolution global Gibbs energy minimization algorithm is now available for two phases flashes.


Version 1.1.3

- The multi-start Nelder-Mead algorithm, used for global Gibbs energy minimization in biphasic flash, has been replaced by a much more
 efficient simulated anneling algorithm, with a final smoothing of the result by some loops of successive substituion.



Version 1.1

- All structures are now defined in the "FFbasic.h" file.

- Stability check by Michelsen, and global optimizer, methodologies added.

- Two phases flash, according to Michelsen methodology improved.

- Two phases flash by global optimizer added.
