Version 1.1.4
- An improved simulation annealing algorithm is now used for both tangent plane, and global Gibbs energy, minimization. The algorithm stores the best result obtained at high temperatures and performs a final loop at low temperature to improve accuracy.
- A differential evolution global Gibbs energy minimization algorithm is now available for two phases flashes.

Version 1.1.3
- The multi-start Nelder-Mead algorithm, used for global Gibbs energy minimization in biphasic flash, has been replaced for a much more efficient simulated anneling algorithm, with a final smoothing of the result by some loops of successive substituion.

Version 1.1
- All structures are now defined in the "FFbasic.h" file.
- Stability check by Michelsen, and global optimizer, methodologies added.
- Two phases flash, according to Michelsen methodology improved.
- Two phases flash by global optimizer added.
- Code cleaning and bugs correction.
