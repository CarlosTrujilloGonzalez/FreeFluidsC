Version 1.1.5
- Modified the record FF_BaseProp, adding: Radius of gyration, Paracor, melting temperature and enthalpy, and ideal gas formation heats and entropy.
 This makes the record incompatible with previous exportations.
- Modified the record FF_SubstanceData adding data and temperature for refractive index.
- Added pressure correction for liquid viscosity, according to Lucas method.
- Added liquid viscosity of mixtures, according to Grunberg-Nissan and Teja-Rice methods.
- Added liquid thermal conductivity prediction according to Latini's method.
- Added liquid thermal conductivity for mixtures according to Li's method.
- Added surface tension calculation for pure substances, according to McLeod-Sugden and Sastri-Rao methods.
- Added surface tension calculation for mixtures, according to linear, Winterfeld and McLeod-Sugden methods.
- Added gas viscosity prediction for pure substances according to Lucas method.
- Added gas viscosity calculation for mixtures, according to Wilke method.
- Added gas viscosity calculation for mixtures, according to Lucas method, including pressure correction.
- Added gas thermal conductivity prediction, and pressure correction, both according to Chung's method.
- Added low pressure thermal conductivity calculation for mixtures, according to Mason and Saxena methodology.

Version 1.1.4

- An improved simulation annealing algorithm is now used for both tangent plane, and global Gibbs energy, minimization.
 The algorithm stores the best result obtained at high temperatures and performs a final loop at low temperature to improve accuracy.

- A differential evolution global Gibbs energy minimization algorithm is now available for two phases flashes.



Version 1.1.3

- The multi-start Nelder-Mead algorithm, used for global Gibbs energy minimization in biphasic flash, has been replaced by a much more
 efficient simulated anneling algorithm, with a final smoothing of the result by some loops of successive substituion.



Version 1.1

- All structures are now defined in the "FFbasic.h" file.

- Stability check by Michelsen, and global optimizer, methodologies added.

- Two phases flash, according to Michelsen methodology improved.

- Two phases flash by global optimizer added.
